What if there was a version of ThinkUp for article-saving apps like Pocket, Pinboard, and Instapaper?

It's an idea. I hardly know any JS, but it's an idea. 

## API options
I've looked at Pocket, Pinboard, Instapaper, and Readability. Others I should look at?
* [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/developer/docs/v3/retrieve): Does seem to support this behavior.
* [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/api): Also seems to support this.
* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/api/full): Seems primarily geared toward reading & modifying content apps.
* [Readability](https://readability.com/developers/api/reader): Seems to support this.
