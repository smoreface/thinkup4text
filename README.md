What if there was a version of ThinkUp for article-saving apps like Pocket, Pinboard, and Instapaper?

It's an idea. I hardly know any JS, but it's an idea. 

## API options
I've looked at Pocket, Pinboard, Instapaper, and Readability. Others I should look at?
* Pocket: http://getpocket.com/developer/docs/v3/retrieve 
* Pinboard: https://pinboard.in/api
* Instapaper: https://www.instapaper.com/api/full 
* Readability: https://readability.com/developers/api/reader

Pocket does seem to support this behavior. 
Pinboard does too. 
Instapaper's API seems primarily geared toward reading and modifying content-based apps. 
Readability does seem to support this behavior.
